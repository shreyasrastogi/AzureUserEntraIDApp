# Use Case

**Programming Parrot Corp** is going through an expansion phase. There are lot of users joining in different departments spread across different locations and also there are lot of seasonal wokers joining.
Programming Parrot Corp uses Entra ID for authentication and to provide access to various SAAS Applications . Now Once the User joins diffferent department managers raise requests for user accounts in Entra ID.
Entra ID admins is pretty swamped with requests and there is a backlog of requests to create user accounts which is causing delay  in user account creation or modification for exisitng users.
Programming Parrot Corp is looking for a Solution which can be rolled out to users acorss different locations where tasks can be performed in self serve mode.

Programming Parrot Corp also wants to rollout solution **faster , easy to maintain  and keep the solution cost low** .

# Local Development Setup

## Overview
To run the Azure Functions project locally, you need to create a `local.settings.json` file in the root directory of the project. This file contains configuration settings and secrets required for local development.

## Steps to Create `local.settings.json`

### 1. Create the File
In the root directory of your Azure Functions project, create a file named `local.settings.json`.

### 2. Add Configuration Settings
Open the `local.settings.json` file and add the necessary configuration settings. Below is an example configuration for an Azure Functions project that includes settings for Azure Storage, Azure AD authentication, and a sentiment analysis API.

 ### local.settings.json
 
 ```
{
    "IsEncrypted": false,
    "Values": {
        "AzureWebJobsStorage": "UseDevelopmentStorage=true",
        "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "dotnet-isolated",
        "ClientId": "your-client-id",
        "TenantId": "your-tenant-id",
        "ClientSecret": "your-client-secret",
        "SentimentAnalysisApiKey": "your-sentiment-analysis-api-key",
        "SentimentAnalysisEndpoint": "https://your-sentiment-analysis-endpoint.cognitiveservices.azure.com/"
    },
    "Host": {
        "CORS": "*",
        "CORSCredentials": false
    }
}

```

### Configuration Settings Explained
- **IsEncrypted**: Indicates whether the settings are encrypted. Set to `false` for local development.
- **Values**: Contains key-value pairs for various configuration settings.
  - **AzureWebJobsStorage**: Connection string for Azure Storage. Use `UseDevelopmentStorage=true` for local development.
  - **FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME**: Specifies the runtime for Azure Functions. Set to `dotnet-isolated` for .NET isolated process.
  - **ClientId**: The client ID of your Azure Entra ID application.
  - **TenantId**: The tenant ID of your Azure Entra ID.
  - **ClientSecret**: The client secret of your Azure Entra ID application.
  - **SentimentAnalysisApiKey**: The API key for the sentiment analysis service.
  - **SentimentAnalysisEndpoint**: The endpoint URL for the sentiment analysis service.
- **Host**: Contains settings for the local host.
  - **CORS**: Specifies allowed origins for CORS. Use `*` to allow all origins.
  - **CORSCredentials**: Indicates whether credentials are supported for CORS. Set to `false` for local development.

## Adding `local.settings.json` to `.gitignore`
To ensure that sensitive information in `local.settings.json` is not committed to source control, add the following line to your `.gitignore` file:
